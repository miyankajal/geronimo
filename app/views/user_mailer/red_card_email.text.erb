Dear Sir/Ma'am,
===============================================

This is to inform you that your ward, <%= @student.first_name %> <%= @student.last_name %>, has been given a Red Card for <% @point.description %> and a total of <% @point.value %> points have been deducted from his disciplinary points. Getting one Red Card results in dismissal from the school.    

This is for your immediate attention. Please meet the Principal as soon as possible. You can login to the site to see your ward's disciplinary points at <%= @url %>.

Yours sincerely,
School Administration.
